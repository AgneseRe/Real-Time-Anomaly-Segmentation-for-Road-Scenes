# BiSeNet Fine-Tuning Resources

This folder contains only some of the files generated during the **BiSeNet** fine-tuning process, starting from the official pretrained model. It includes:

* **automated_log.txt**: Plain text file that contains in columns the following info of each epoch {Epoch, Train-loss,Test-loss,Train-IoU,Test-IoU, learningRate}.
* **best.txt**: Plain text file containing a line with the best IoU achieved and its epoch.
* **bisenet.py**: copy of the model file used. 
* **model_best.pth**: saved weights of the epoch that achieved best val accuracy.
* **model.txt**: Plain text that displays the model's layers.
* **opts.txt**: Plain text file containing the options used during fine-tuning.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the large size of certain files ‚Äî some of them exceed GitHub‚Äôs file size limitations ‚Äî they have been stored externally on Google Drive to keep the repository lightweight and manageable. In addition to the previous files, in the Drive you can also find **checkpoint.pth.tar** that contains the checkpoint of the last trained epoch, and **model_best.pth.tar** that contains the same parameters as "checkpoint.pth.tar" but for the epoch with best val accuracy.
